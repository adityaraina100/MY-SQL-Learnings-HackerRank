Some important functions and clauses that I encountered(Keeping them here for my future reference also).
1).The OVER clause is powerful in that you can have aggregates over different ranges ("windowing"), whether you use a GROUP BY or not.
2).The REPEAT() function repeats a string as many times as specified.
3). Synatx for Inner Join:
  INNER JOIN ON COLUMN NAME FROM ONE TABLE=COLUMN NAME FROM OTHER TABLE
4).repeat("string","number of times")
